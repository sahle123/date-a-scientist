# I purposefully left this file empty since running all the code at once would take a lengthy amount of time,
# especially so for the section that uses an SVC. I also had to the delete the profiles.csv file in order to
# submit this. There were extra files for exploration, but I removed them for the sake of brevity.
#
# To save time, I have separated out the files for your convenience
#


# 1. For both the multi-linear regression and K-nearest neighbors implementation code, navigate to:
    # smokers_2_Regression.py 
    # and execute it.

# 2. For the naive bayes' classifier implementation code, navigate to: 
    # smokers_2_NBC.py 
    # and execute it.

# 3. For the naive bayes' classifier that lets you type a phrase and has the classifier guess, go to:
    # smokers_2.py 
    # and change the variable LE_TEST_TEXT to whatever phrase you want, then execute it.

# 4. For the support vector classifier, go to:
    # smokers_2_SVC.py 
    # and execute it.
